Music Bot is a exploratory experiment (because that's not redundant or anything) in hooking together Johnny-Five, Socket.io, and the Web Audio API.

## Install

```
npm install && bower install
```

## Start

```
npm start
```

You can then fire up the web browser that delights you the most and take it for a spin. Ideally, pressing a button on your hardware should cause sound to be created in the browser.
